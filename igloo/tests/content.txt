Content types in Igloo
========================================================

Basic Usage
------------------------

Any content you like which is an Axiom Item can be stored in the database, 
however sometimes you want to expose some of these items to the Igloo admin.

By creating a class which implements IContentType, and installs the Content 
powerup, you can do that.

So lets start by creating a store.
 
    >>> from axiom.store import Store
	>>> from axiom.item import Item
    >>> store = Store()

Now, let's create a class to represent an article:

	>>> from axiom.attributes import text, reference
	>>> from axiom import dependency
	>>> from igloo.iigloo import IContentType
	>>> from igloo.content import Content
	>>> from zope.interface import implements
	>>> class Article(Item):
	... 	"""A News Article"""
	... 	implements(IContentType)
	... 	path = u"news"
	... 	name = u"News Article"
	... 	title = text()
	... 	author = text()
	... 	text = text()
	... 	content = reference()
	... 	def __init__(self, **kw): 
	... 		Item.__init__(self, **kw)
	... 		self.content = Content(store=self.store)
	... 		dependency.installOn(self.content, self)

and register it with our Site:

	>>> from igloo.content import Site, ContentType
	>>> site = Site(store=store, title=u"Tech News")
	>>> site.registerContentType(Article)

We can check what content types are installed on a Site:

	>>> list(site.getContentTypes())
	[News Article]
	
Now we can instantiate an article, and add it to the Site

	>>> articleNevow = Article(store=store, title=u"Introducing Nevow, one kickass web framework.")
	>>> site.addContent(articleNevow)
